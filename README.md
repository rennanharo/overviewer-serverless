# Overviewer Serverless

This is a fork of the [Overviewer](https://github.com/rennanharo/overviewer) for running as a serverless service. <br />
The main difference is that instead of being a web application, this fork has been designed to be implemented using cloud services, mainly Google Cloud Platform. <br /> <br />
The diagram below represents the sctructure of the project and the respective services used. <br />
